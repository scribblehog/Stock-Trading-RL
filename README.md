# Stock-Trading-RL

This program is partly based on the work of Yang et al. - https://github.com/AI4Finance-Foundation/Deep-Reinforcement-Learning-for-Automated-Stock-Trading-Ensemble-Strategy-ICAIF-2020
Specifically, the modules, "RUN STRATEGY", "TRAINING ENVIRONMENT", and "MODEL TRAINING" use the above code as a basis, although they have all been modified significantly from the original program.
Other modules are completely original, such as the data manipulation stages, MPT and S&P sections, and the data analysis.
